split input by lines

Skip all lines that contain "no other bags".
Take all lines that contain target color, store first two words and store in a set.
Iterate over lines again, store all lines that contain anything in set.
Repeat until iteration finds no things to add.

Sum result.

THEN 

find target color and see how many numbers of other colors it contains.
Keep looping through colors until you find how many items the target color contains.
