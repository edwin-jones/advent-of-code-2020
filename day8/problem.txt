You have a list of opcodes with three possible commands, acc, jmp and nop.
Add the values as you go along into an accumulator, ignore nop operations and apply jmp ops.
Keep track of each line you execute and return the value of the accumulator BEFORE any command/line
is executed a second time.

THEN

Same as above, but attempt to "fix" the program by replacing the value on all non acc op lines.
Turn jmp commands into nop commands and vice versa one by one.
Find the permutation that exits correctly and return the accumulator's value in this case.
